# Use ChatGPT to Help Edit and Improve Your Writing

Hiring an editor to help with your writing can be very expensive. I've seen editing services cost between $50 - $120 per hour. ChatGPT may be a useful tool to help you edit and improve your writing. An editor may still be helpful to help you with the ordering of ideas and flow of a paper, but at least you won't be spending money to fix the mechanics of your writing. 

## Writing Process and Useful Prompts

* If you're having a hard time writing, you might ask ChatGPT to suggest elements to discuss about a particular topic.

```
You are an academic writing coach in health sciences. Please suggest relevant elements to discuss about quality improvement projects.
``` 

* If you're having a hard time organizing thoughts into paragraphs, you might try listing different thoughts as bullet points, and asking ChatGPT to suggest a good way to organize those sentences into paragraphs.

```
Could you please recommend a good way to organize these sentences into paragraphs:
	• Paragraphs should be well-formed.
	• Paragraphs should have a topic sentence or sentences. 
	• Usually, the topic sentence is the first sentence in a paragraph, but occasionally the main topic in a paragraph may be spelled out over the first couple of sentences.
	• Supporting points that elaborate on the topic sentence should be found in the body of the paragraph.
	• It is often useful to include the point of writing the paragraph. 
	• The point of a paragraph will usually come either at the beginning of the paragraph after the main topic, or at the end of the paragraph after the body of the discussion about the topic.
	• I also like to talk about cats.
	• Cats are one of my favorite animals.

## Editing Process and Useful Prompts

I asked ChatGPT to suggest some steps to edit an academic paper.

	• What are the steps to edit a scholarly paper?
		1. Review the Guidelines:
			• Familiarize yourself with the specific guidelines provided by the journal or institution. Ensure that the paper meets all formatting and submission requirements.
		2. Read for Content:
			• Read the paper through once to understand the overall content and argument. Check if the paper has a clear thesis statement and if each section contributes to the overall argument.
		3. Check Structure and Organization:
			• Ensure that the paper has a logical flow of ideas and a well-organized structure. Check if each paragraph has a clear topic sentence and if there are smooth transitions between paragraphs and sections.
		4. Verify Citations and References:
			• Check that all citations are accurate and properly formatted according to the required citation style (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.). Verify that the references match the citations in the text.
		5. Grammar and Style:
			• Review the paper for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and punctuation errors. Ensure that the writing style is consistent throughout the paper.
		6. Clarity and Conciseness:
			• Edit for clarity, removing unnecessary words or jargon. Ensure that complex ideas are expressed in a clear and concise manner. Consider the target audience and adjust the language accordingly.
		7. Check for Consistent Tone:
			• Ensure that the tone of the paper is consistent. Scholarly writing often requires a formal and objective tone, so avoid language that may be too casual or subjective.
		8. Evaluate Argument and Evidence:
			• Assess the strength of the argument and the supporting evidence. Verify that the evidence is relevant, accurate, and cited appropriately. Check if the argument is persuasive and well-supported.
		9. Check for Redundancy:
			• Eliminate redundant phrases or repetitive information. Ensure that each sentence contributes something new to the paper.
		10. Review Tables and Figures:
			• If the paper includes tables, figures, or other visual elements, check them for accuracy and clarity. Ensure that they are properly labeled and referenced in the text.
		11. Consider Formatting:
			• Double-check formatting details such as font size, line spacing, and margins. Ensure consistency in the formatting of headings, subheadings, and other stylistic elements.
		12. Proofread:
			• Carefully proofread the entire paper for any remaining errors. It's often helpful to read the paper aloud or have someone else review it to catch errors that might be overlooked.
		13. Seek Feedback:
			• If possible, have someone else read the paper and provide feedback. Fresh eyes can often spot issues that the author might have missed.
		14. Final Check:
			• Perform a final check to ensure that all changes have been made correctly and that the paper is ready for submission. 
   

I asked ChatGPT for some prompts to help with specific steps.

## Older Attempts and Information

Here is an example of feedback provided by ChatGPT on a paragraph and some other writing examples. 

* I started with the following paragraph:

>Little is known about the reasons behind the disparity of heavy mental health burdens and low levels of treatment among NHPIs. Two studies have attempted to explore this, specifically in NHPIs and Polynesians. Allen et al. (2016) found that Polynesians have neutral attitudes toward seeking treatment, with women showing more positive attitudes than men, and that men have higher self-stigma, but women have an increased public stigma. Culturally congruent practices for coping with distress were also reported as more beneficial than treatment. Subica et al. (2019b) found that NHPIs reported more stigma toward mental illness in ways likely to impede help-seeking than the US public. Additionally, another study specifically of Samoan NHPIs also reflected mental illness stigma, as well as other barriers such as low levels of mental health awareness, shame associated with mental illness, lack of knowledge of mental health problems, and a perceived lack of culturally responsive providers (Yamada et al. 2019).

* Log into ChatGPT. (https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/). (I sign in using my Google account.)
* Start a new chat. (I recommend starting a new chat when looking at a new topic. Adding prompts at the end of an existing topic may cause responses to be influenced by previous entries in the chat.)
  * ![New chat](https://github.com/cmcntsh/UseChatGPtEdit/blob/main/images/ChatGPTNewChat.png)
* I entered all of these prompts by typing the text, using Shift-Enter to move to a new line, pasting the paragaph into the text entry box, and hitting Enter to submit. In each of these examples you'll see the prompt I entered followed by the response from ChatGPT.

### Useful prompts

* You are editing a scholarly paper. Provide responses that use a scholarly tone and complete explanations. Improve this [section, paragraph, sentence, etc.]: [Paste text here.]
* Paraphrase the text using more academic and scientific language. Use a neutral tone and avoid repetitions of words and phrases.
* You are editing a scholarly paper about a healthcare quality improvement project following the SQUIRE 2.0 guidelines. Please revise this section to improve the logic and flow of the content. Use scholarly and scientific language. Use a neutral tone. Provide complete explanations, but avoid repetitions of words and phrases.
  * I tried this prompt with a longer section of text. It did a good job of improving the language. It did not significantly improve the overall organization. (There was a lot of jumping back and forth between topics and repeating some elements.) However, I followed up with a request to reorganize the text into main sections about x, y, and z and that made a big difference. The resulting rewrite was more organized.
* You are editing a scholarly paper about a healthcare quality improvement project. Using scholarly language and a neutral tone, revise this paragraph to use active voice: [paste sentence or paragraph here]
* You are an expert editor of scholarly papers familiar with the concepts of the reader expectation approach to writing promoted by George Gopen. Please improve this paragraph and explain your rationale for the changes you suggest:
