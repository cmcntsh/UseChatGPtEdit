# Use ChatGPT to Help Edit and Improve Your Writing

ChatGPT may be a useful tool to help you edit and improve your writing. Here is an example of feedback provided by ChatGPT on a paragraph. 

* I started with the following paragraph:

>Little is known about the reasons behind the disparity of heavy mental health burdens and low levels of treatment among NHPIs. Two studies have attempted to explore this, specifically in NHPIs and Polynesians. Allen et al. (2016) found that Polynesians have neutral attitudes toward seeking treatment, with women showing more positive attitudes than men, and that men have higher self-stigma, but women have an increased public stigma. Culturally congruent practices for coping with distress were also reported as more beneficial than treatment. Subica et al. (2019b) found that NHPIs reported more stigma toward mental illness in ways likely to impede help-seeking than the US public. Additionally, another study specifically of Samoan NHPIs also reflected mental illness stigma, as well as other barriers such as low levels of mental health awareness, shame associated with mental illness, lack of knowledge of mental health problems, and a perceived lack of culturally responsive providers (Yamada et al. 2019).
